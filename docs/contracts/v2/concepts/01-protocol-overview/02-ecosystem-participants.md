title: Ecosystem Participants
---

The Rails Network Swap ecosystem includes three main participant types: liquidity providers, traders, and developers. Liquidity providers supply [ERC-20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20) tokens to shared liquidity pools, incentivized by earning a portion of the [0.30% trading fee](../advanced-topics/fees). Traders exchange these tokens at a fixed fee, benefiting liquidity providers in the process. Developers have the opportunity to harness the Rails Network Swap smart contracts, enabling innovative token-based services, trading platforms, retail experiences, and more.

These interactions collectively foster a vibrant digital economy, establishing a unified framework for token pooling, trading, and utilization.

## Liquidity Providers

The liquidity providers (LPs) within the ecosystem vary widely:

- **Passive LPs** are investors who aim to earn trading fees by allocating their assets into the pools without active management.

- **Professional LPs** engage in active market making, often developing bespoke tools to monitor and manage their positions across various DeFi initiatives.

- **Token projects** may participate as LPs to ensure their tokens are readily tradable, enhancing their market presence and enabling seamless integration with other DeFi platforms via Rails Network Swap.

- **Innovative DeFi entities** are delving into complex liquidity strategies, such as incentivized pools or using liquidity for collateral, leveraging Rails Network Swap’s flexible infrastructure for experimental finance.

## Traders

Traders in the ecosystem fall into different groups:

- **Speculators** leverage community-developed tools and services to execute token swaps, drawing liquidity from Rails Network Swap.

- **Arbitrage bots** aim to profit by capitalizing on price differentials across markets, inadvertently contributing to price consistency across the Rails Network ecosystem.

- **DAPP users** acquire tokens through Rails Network Swap for various applications within the Rails Network.

- **Smart contracts** automate trading processes, ranging from DEX aggregators to bespoke Solidity scripts, all operating under the same fixed trading fee, thereby facilitating price accuracy and liquidity momentum.

## Developers and Projects

Rails Network Swap’s role in the broader Rails Network ecosystem is extensive and varied:

- With its open-source framework, Rails Network Swap supports a multitude of user experience innovations and interface designs, evident in many leading DeFi dashboards and specialized tools developed by the community.

- Wallet services commonly include swap and liquidity functionalities, integrating closely with Rails Network Swap.

- DEX aggregators source liquidity from multiple platforms, often prioritizing Rails Network Swap due to its substantial liquidity pool, to optimize trading values for their users.

- Developers explore new DeFi applications using Rails Network Swap’s comprehensive functionalities, leading to a diverse range of financial tools and experiments.

## The Rails Network Swap Community

The ongoing development and success of the Rails Network Swap protocol are driven by the collaborative efforts of its dedicated team and the expansive community, continually shaping and enhancing the ecosystem.
