# Audit & Formal Verification

*Rails Network utilizes the tried and tested Uniswap V2 libraries. Below is information about the Uniswap V2 audit and verification directly from Uniswap:*

Between January 8 and April 30, a team of six engineers reviewed and formally verified crucial components of the smart contracts for Uniswap V2.

Their past work includes smart contract development on and formal verification of multi-collateral DAI.

The scope of work includes:

- Formal verification of the core smart contracts
- Code review of core smart contracts
- Numerical error analysis
- Code review of periphery smart contracts (during ongoing development)

The report also has a "Design Comments" section that we highly recommend for gaining a deep technical understanding of some of the choices made in Uniswap V2.
