This section serves as a guide to the Rails Network Swap Subgraph, detailing its role in collating and indexing data from the Rails Network Swap contracts. The subgraph compiles information on pairs, tokens, and the broader Rails Network Swap environment, refreshing with each transaction on the platform. Hosted on [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/) protocol, the subgraph is accessible for public queries.

## Resources

Explore the [Subgraph Explorer](https://graph.steamexchange.io) for a hands-on experience with the data querying interface and developer endpoints.

## Usage

The subgraph not only captures the live state of the Rails Network Swap but also archives its historical data, currently fueling the analytics for the Rails Network Swap information dashboard.

## Making Queries

For guidance on how to execute queries on a subgraph, visit [The Graph's documentation](https://thegraph.com/docs/about/introduction).
