# The Rails Network Swap Smart Contracts

The pages here contain conceptual and technical documentation of the Rails Network Swap protocol.

If you are new to Rails Network, you might want to check out the [Rails Overview](../../concepts/overview) first.

# Developer links

The following links will help you on your journey of building on the Rails Network:

- [`Apply for Authorization`](https://www.jotform.com/form/233264447089059)
- [`Testnet Explorer`](https://explore.steamexchange.io)
- [`Subgraph`](https://graph.steamexchange.io)

*Note: Authorization is required even for Rails Network Testnet*

The Rails Network SDK and Boilerplate will be available in the future.
