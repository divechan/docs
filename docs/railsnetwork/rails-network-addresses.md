Rails Network is an EVM compatible layer 1 blockchain developed by Steam Exchange Inc. Rails Network is driven by a proprietary consensus mechanism called Proof of Work by Authority (PoWbA). This protocol was designed to curb bad actors by mandating authorization before a developer or project team can deploy to the chain. This is done through a strict vetting process.
